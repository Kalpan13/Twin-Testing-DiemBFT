phase 4: Implementation of Twins and Testing of diemBFT

PLATFORM:

The software platforms that are used in testing the algorithm are:


OS: 
Windows-10 : WSL2 (Windows Sub-System for Linux)

Python Implementation:
CPython


Python Versions used to test:
Python 3.7.12


DistAlgo Version used for implementation:
1.1.0b15


Type of host:
Laptop


BUGS AND LIMITATIONS:
-- Sync up of validators is not possible
â€“- Depending on the system processing performance, the value of delta(highest time for executing one round) can change. Adjust the value of delta depending on the delta
